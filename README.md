# 🌾 Smart Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Python by Manoj

This project is a Smart Crop Recommendation System that suggests the best crop for cultivation based on soil and weather parameters.  
It uses **Machine Learning** algorithms to analyze key environmental factors like **Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH**, and **Rainfall** to recommend the most suitable crop.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing with Python

1. 📥 Load dataset using Pandas  
2. 🧼 Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, scale features)  
3. 🔄 Apply feature engineering (one-hot encoding, normalization)  
4. 🤖 Train models using Random Forest & Decision Tree  
5. 📊 Evaluate model performance (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## 🎨 Flask Web Application

The web app provides an intuitive interface where users can input soil and weather parameters and instantly receive the most recommended crop for cultivation.

---

## 🔹 How It Works

1. ✅ User inputs: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall  
2. 📈 ML model processes inputs and predicts the best crop  
3. 🧾 The result is displayed on the web interface
