# CROP-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
🌾 Smart Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Python
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Smart Crop Recommendation System that suggests the best crop for cultivation based on soil and weather parameters. The system utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to analyze environmental factors such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall to recommend the most suitable crop.

🔹 Key Highlights:
✅ Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation
✅ Preprocessing of Agricultural Data
✅ Deployment using Flask for a user-friendly web interface
✅ Interactive Web Application for farmers and stakeholders

🚀 Features
✨ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling
✨ Machine Learning Model – Trained using Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM for better accuracy
✨ Web Application – Developed using Flask to provide real-time crop recommendations
✨ Interactive User Input – Allows users to enter soil and weather conditions to receive accurate crop suggestions

🛠️ Technologies Used
💻 Python – Data Processing & Model Training
📊 Scikit-Learn – Machine Learning Models
📌 Flask – Web Application Deployment
📈 Pandas & NumPy – Data Preprocessing
🌍 Jupyter Notebook – Model Training & Visualization

📂 Project Structure
🔹 Data Preprocessing with Python
1️⃣ Loaded the dataset using Pandas
2️⃣ Cleaned and preprocessed data (handling missing values, scaling features)
3️⃣ Applied Feature Engineering (One-Hot Encoding, Scaling)
4️⃣ Trained the ML model using Random Forest & Decision Tree
5️⃣ Evaluated model accuracy using Precision, Recall, and F1-score

🎨 Flask Web Application
The Flask Web App allows users to input soil & weather conditions and get crop recommendations instantly.

🔹 How It Works:
1️⃣ User inputs Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall
2️⃣ The ML model predicts the best crop for cultivation
3️⃣ The result is displayed on the web interface
